# Comparative Analysis of Liver Diseases Using Machine Learning  
(Academic Minor Project)

This project was completed as part of my academic **minor project** and
focuses on applying multiple machine learning algorithms to analyze and
predict liver disease using clinical data.

The goal of the project is to compare the performance of different ML
models and identify the most effective approach for disease prediction.

## Project Overview
Liver diseases are a major health concern and early detection plays a
critical role in treatment and patient outcomes. This project uses
machine learning techniques to analyze clinical datasets and predict the
presence of liver disease.

The work emphasizes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection and transformation
- Training multiple ML models
- Comparative performance evaluation

---

## Dataset
The dataset used consists of clinical attributes related to liver
function such as enzyme levels, age, and other medical indicators.

Due to academic and data privacy considerations, the full dataset is not
included in this repository. The project focuses on model comparison and
evaluation methodology.

---

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used
The following algorithms were implemented and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each model was trained on the same dataset to ensure a fair comparison.

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score

These metrics were used to determine the most effective algorithm for
liver disease prediction.

## Key Outcomes
- Compared multiple ML algorithms on a healthcare dataset
- Identified the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics
- Demonstrated the impact of preprocessing and feature selection on
  model performance
- Gained practical experience in applying ML techniques to medical data

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Note
This repository represents an **academic minor project** focused on
learning and comparative analysis. The implementations are intended for
educational purposes rather than clinical deployment.
